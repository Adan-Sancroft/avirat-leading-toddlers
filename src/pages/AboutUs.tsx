                Children inherently love to learn and they grow by sharing their
                discoveries with each other, their teachers and parents.
                Learning begins with the self, followed by building
                relationships with nature and society. This is the journey of
                true education, and life.

                Avirat is a guiding star which ushers the knowledge seekers into
                the realm of success and fame. Education is no longer confined
                only within the four walls of a classroom. All round efforts are
                required to provide qualitative, activity and value based
                education in our school.

                Avirat Leading Toddlers is more than a playschool â€” it is a
                garden of dreams, where every tiny seed (our students) is
                nurtured with care, respect, and the freedom to bloom at its own
                pace. As Director, I have had the unique privilege of watching
                not only the children evolve, but also our institution grow
                steadily in vision, scope, and excellence.
              </p>
              <p className="message-text">
                As we look forward to the years ahead of us, our commitment
                remains rooted in continuous improvement. We aim for continuous
                improvement in structured assessment methods while staying
                play-focused, and also encourage our staff for professional
                development to ensure that we are always at the forefront of
                early childhood education.

                of the remarkable journey that we at Avirat have embarked upon.
                It has taken the sincere efforts from both staff and parents to
                ensure the best quality for our shared journey of nurturing the
                early years of our children's education.

                Playschool is more than just a starting point of education â€”
                it's where the very foundation of a child's personality, values,
                curiosity, and social understanding begins to form. Here at
                Avirat, we have always prioritized a child-first approach in all
                our practices.

                As we continue to grow, our focus remains on providing a safe,
                nurturing, and stimulating environment where every child can
                thrive. We are committed to fostering a culture of respect,
                inclusivity, and continuous learning for both our students and
                staff.
