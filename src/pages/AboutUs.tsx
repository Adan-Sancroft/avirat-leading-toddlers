                I warmly welcome you to the Annual General Meeting for the year
                2024-25. Each AGM is not just a formal gathering, but a
                reflection of the shared dreams, values, and progress we've
                achieved together.

                Avirat Learning Tree is more than a playschool ‚Äî it is a garden
                of dreams, where every tiny seed (our students) is nurtured with
                care, respect, and the freedom to bloom at its own pace. As
                Director, I have had the unique privilege of watching not only
                the children evolve, but also our institution grow steadily in
                vision, scope, and excellence.
              </p>

                As we look forward to the year ahead, our commitment remains

                structured assessment methods while staying play-focused, and
                offer more workshops for staff development.

                As we gather once again for the Annual General Meeting for the
                academic year 2024-25, my heart is filled with gratitude, pride,
                and joy. This year has been yet another remarkable chapter in
                our shared journey of nurturing the early years of our
                children's education.
              </p>
              <p className="message-text">
                Playschool is more than just a starting point of education ‚Äî
                it's where the very foundation of a child's personality, values,
                curiosity, and social understanding begins to form. Here at
                Avirat, we have always prioritized a child-first approach in all
                our practices.
              </p>
              <p className="message-text">
                This year, our little ones participated in a variety of hands-on
                and experiential activities that enhanced their motor skills,
                social awareness, and cognitive development. From cultural
                celebrations to life skills activities, every moment has been a
                learning opportunity filled with joy and discovery.
